To install react globally on your machine
npm install create-react-app -g 

Components are a functions that return JSX code.

When writing JSX we're not actually using HTML tags like div or h1, they are being provided by React, and behind scenes are converted into actual HMTL.

Only changing state and props will lead React to update DOM.

Stateful component is a component that manages state using class or functions with hooks.
Stateless are componets that have no state management like Person.js
Usually you should use as many stateless components that don't affect your state so it's more predictable making your app more easy to maintain and manage.

Styles will be injected dynamically by webpack that manages imports that we add, we don't add them manually inside our HTML files.

We don't want to mutate/edit original state of our components because this can lead to many unpredictible errors, instead we should make a copy of the state before manipulating it.

To be able to not use css classes globally and instead use them in specific places in our app we add module to filename App.module.css, and then import classes from './App.module.css', and then we can pass classes to any component that we want eg. 
className={classes.red}
